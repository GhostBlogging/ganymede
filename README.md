# Ganymede

Ganymede is a content-focused, deploy-ready theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/), designed for my personal blog [The Third Attempt](https://blog.mingjie.info).

The theme is based on [Callisto](https://github.com/jckyeh/Callisto-Ghost-Theme) by [@jckyeh](https://github.com/jckyeh/).
